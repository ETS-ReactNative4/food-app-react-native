MAKING NETWORK REQUESTS

fetch: built in function for making network requests
        error handling is a bit weird
        requires us to write a lot of wrappeer code to make it work 'sensibly'

axios: separe library for making requests 
(used) easy to us, sensible defaults
       increases our app size (very, very slightly)
      npm install axios


Flow in SearchScreen Component

-> SearchScreen function called
-> searchApi called immediately
-> make request to yelp API
-> get search results, call setter
-> updated state causes component to rerender

use effect is a hook or essentially a function that allows us to run some 
snippet of code just one time when our component is first rendered to the screen.

run the arrow function every time the component is rendered
useState(() = {})

run the arrow function only when the component is first rendered
useState(() => {}, [])

run the arrow function only wheen the component is first rendered and when the value changes
useState(() => {}, [value])
